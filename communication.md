****Jina AI workshops -- a communication plan (outside of github)****

**What are Jina AI workshops?**

Jina Ai Workshops are an opportunity to learn how to build your own app using neural searching engines. Step by step, through these workshops you will learn the basic of Jina AI and learn about neural search.

**Where can they be found?**

Youtube, Github; links to them can be found on JINA AI Website as well as JINA AI's Social Media Channels

**How to promote the Workshops and engage the community?**

We will create an integrated communication plan, encompassing all existent and potential offline and online channels to promote JINA AI and Jina AI workshops. For this purpose, we will define the target audience, have concise and clear ideas on the goals and objectives of these workshops and a work out a thorough plan on how to promote these ideas. Using cross channel marketing, we will cross promote activities on all our channels. We will attend workshops, events, seminars, conferences where we will present and discuss around our workshops. We will create events and gatherings where we will test and promote our workshops.

**Purpose of the plan:**

(note: this is just an outline of a plan, a more detailed strategy will be created later)

The purpose of this communication strategy is to integrate all channels in order to increase visibility, outreach and engagement on workshops; communicate our missions, goals, activities, news and events to our target audience; engage in meaningful discussions with our community; communicate our news and receive feedback from our users that will later serve to improve the product; Involve users in the product creation; Promote events and activities and attract new users;

Coming up with creative ways to promote these workshops, make them inclusive, diverse, catchy and enjoyable to a wide range of audiences.

Social Involvement -- context over content -- what is happening in the world right now and how does JINA AI help face these challenges. What are the major current challenges and biases in neural search engineering and how does JIna AI wants to help face them.

How to create a safe-space and an inclusive community where diversity, innovation and differences are celebrated within the neural search and tech industry.

**Target audience:**

**Primary:** Developers, Engineers, Startups, Businesses, Neural Search scholars, open source enthusiasts;\
**Secondary:** Neural Search organizations, developer organizations, Hackathon organizers, tech summits and conferences, AI and neural network scholars, academia and institutions;\
**Others:** open source writers/influencers, other institutions looking to incorporate neural search, donors and grant giving organizations. General audience of open source and neural search enthusiast

**Social Media Plan**

**Community events and activities**

Monthly interactive online events with the JINA AI community (in the building) where they can discuss ideas and share information about the ways they use JINA AI and neural search, give feedback on the product, suggest potential changes, create together.

*An example of a Community Building event:*

During six months, our developers, users and community get together to create and discuss. After 6 months they are invited to the Final Event, an (online) conference organized by JINA AI

**How:**
A series of online gatherings in the form of interactive events (this can be in any platform/channel and in any form) where the community can discus (and maybe create working groups).  Participants can share not only their ideas and feedback on how they use JINA AI, but also promote their businesses and ideas, share stories and participate in creative activities that will be ideated for the purpose of these meetings. 

**What's in it for them:** An opportunity to connect to other developers, users and community members, learn, create business opportunities, promote and advertise their products and initiatives, become involved in the building of a product; Opportunity to meet and discuss with potential employees/employers; Learning from experts and specialists; Opportunity to present their work at the final event.

**What's in it for JINA AI:** the creation of a Community of users and experts that will provide with feedback on the product, suggest ideas and changes and increase the visibility of the product as well as attract new users.

**Final event**

A conference/summit organized by JINA AI where except for developers,  invited experts and specialist we will include all the focus group/community members and will revolve around sharing the findings and knowledge gathered during the work together.\
